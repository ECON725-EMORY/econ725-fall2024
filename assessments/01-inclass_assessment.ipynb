    "\n",
    "1.  **Shell Basics**:\n",
    "    -   Open your terminal or command line interface.\n",
    "    -   Identify which shell you are using with the command `echo $SHELL`.\n",
    "    -   Use `man` or `--help` to look up the manual for the `ls` command.\n",
    "2.  **Help!**:\n",
    "    -   For each of the following commands, use `--help` or `man` to find out what they do: `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`.\n",
    "3.  **Navigating Your System**:\n",
    "    -   Navigate to your home directory using `cd`.\n",
    "    -   List all the files and directories in your home directory with a detailed view using `ls -l`.\n",
    "    -   Create a new directory called `econ725_assessment`. Hint: use `mkdir`.\n",
    "4.  **Managing Your Files**:\n",
    "    -   Inside `econ725_assessment`, create a new file called `my_script.sh`. Hint: use `touch`.\n",
    "    -   Copy any text file from your system (you can use those ones covered in class) into this directory and rename it to `sample.txt`. Hint: use `cp`.\n",
    "5.  **Working with Text Files**:\n",
    "    -   Use `cat` to display the contents of `sample.txt`.\n",
    "    -   Use `head` and `tail` to display the first and last 10 lines of `sample.txt`.\n",
    "6.  **Redirects, Pipes, and Loops**:\n",
    "    -   Redirect the output of `ls -l` to a file named `directory_list.txt`.\n",
    "    -   Use a pipe to sort `directory_list.txt` alphabetically and display the results with `less`.\n",
    "7.  **Scripting**:\n",
    "    -   Edit `my_script.sh` to include a `bash` script that prints \"Hello, Data Science!\" to the terminal.\n",
    "    -   Make `my_script.sh` executable with `chmod` and run it.\n"
